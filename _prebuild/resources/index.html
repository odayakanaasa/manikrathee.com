				<p>My design staples. I tend to use fireworks for web &amp; wireframing work, and photoshop for iOS / UI design work.</p>

				<a href="http://xscopeapp.com/" title="Xscope">Xscope</a>
				<p>This is a must for any designer - on screen measuring, loupe for color picking and pixel-perfect guides.</p>

				<h2>Development</h2>
				<a href="" title="">SublimeText 2.0</a>
					<p>Recently graduated from textmate to this split-pane, plugin wielding editor. I am currently using a theme I made, <a href="https://github.com/manikrathee/appealr" title="Appealr">Appealr</a>, and have my user settings up on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/manikrathee/sublime-text" title="SublimeText settings on Github">https://github.com/manikrathee/sublime-text</a></p>
				<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html" title="Chrome Canary">Chrome Canary,</a> <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/" title="Firefox Nightly"></a>Firefox Nightly</a>
					<p>Dev builds for geeking out over new code.</p>
				<a href="http://www.github.com" title="Github">Git &amp; GitHub</a>
					<p>Does this need a description? go.</p>
				<a href="https://github.com/manikrathee/FutureGS/" title="FutureGS">FutureGS</a>
					<p>My custom responsive framework. I've been developing this for a few months, mainly for internal use. Considering opening it up as a downloadable framework in the future. The benefit of this: completely semantic markup and a less-based stylesheet that is optimized for speed. Check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/manikrathee/FutureGS/" title="FutureGS">https://github.com/manikrathee/FutureGS</a> or view my other framework here: <a href="https://github.com/manikrathee/1140gs-Custom" title="1140 Custom">https://github.com/manikrathee/1140gs-Custom</a></p>
				<a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/" title="TotalTerminal">Total Terminal</a>
					<p>Take terminal and set it to a global hot key - it exists across all spaces and doesn't take up screen real-estate.</p>
				<a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/" title="Kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a>
					<p>Awesome tool to view diffs for multiple files - has a command line trigger for use with git.</p>
				<a href="http://panic.com/transmit/" title="Transmit">Transmit</a>
					<p>My FTP app of choice. It lets you mount servers in OSX as drives so you can open directors, copy &amp; paste, etc just like you would with a regular drive. (See one of my applescripts above to take this a step further.)</p>
				<a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" title="Codekit">Codekit</a>
					<p>Must have for LESS &amp; SASS users. Compiles less/sass/js files locally so you don't have to depend on slow server-side compilers. Also gives you the power of javascript file concatenation and linting.</p>


				<h2>Utilities </h2>
				<a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" title="AlfredApp">AlfredApp</a>
					<p>Hide your dock and disable spotlight. Alfred will be your new best friend. You can launch apps, search your iTunes &amp; rdio libraries, email people with specific attachements, navigate your file system and much more - all with a shortcut and a small input field. Check it out - the options are endless.</p>
				<a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="TextExpander">TextExpander</a>
					<p>Take a snippet of text or code that you find yourself typing often, set a single or two-key abbreviation and free yourself. I have hundreds of snippets saved in TE from e-mail signatures, to HTML5 input types, to css 3 transitions with custom fill ins. TE is powerful and will change your life.</p>
				<a href="http://www.rdio.com" title="Rdio">Rdio</a>
					<p>Music. Music Music. Gone are the days of 80gb iTunes libraries. Rdio is the best music streaming service around. Apps for mac, iOS, WP7, android and more. If you aren't using it, you're missing out</p>
				<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a>
					<p>Work in the cloud. You should already have this.</p>
				<a href="http://getcloudapp.com/" title="CloudAPp">CloudApp</a>
					<p>Simple file transfer and image sharing. I have the pro account that lets me sent urls that are shortened to: manik.io - it also is set to auto upload screenshots so I can snap and share instantly. I combine this with <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/new-textexpander-tools-for-bitly-and-cloudapp/" title="TE Snippet">Brett Terpstra's Text Expander script</a> that automatically grabs the direct url for whatever cloud app url is on your clipboard. Big timesaver.</p>
				<a href="http://tapbots.com/software/" title="Tweetbot">Tweetbot</a>
					<p>The best Twitter client for iOS &amp; now Mac as well. Made by Tapbots</p>
				<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/" title="">nvALT</a>
					<p>Brett Terpstra's fork of Notational Velocity, the mac <a href="http://simplenote.com/" title="Simplenote">SimpleNote</a> application. I use this for all kinds of notes - writing down basic ideas, starting out blog posts, keeping project notes and more. A simple method of starting note titles with a #ProjectName lets me organize and search them easily.</p>
				<a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" title="IA Writer">IA Writer</a>
					<p>For longer posts or writing sessions, I'll use IA Writer and just store my files in my Simplenote dropbox directory so it still syncs.</p>
				<a href="http://www.crashplan.com" title="Crashplan">CrashPlan</a>
					<p>Remote backups - I back up my entire family's computers to my drobo &amp; to the crashplan remote server for pennies a year. It's a great service and I'd recommend it to anyone that is looking for peace-of-mind remote backups.</p>
				<a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/" title="Flux">F.lux</a>
					<p>This app detects your location and tints your screen at sun down to prevent eye strain from working long hours. If you're like me and you end up being in front of your computer from 7pm to well after midnight, you need this. I immediately saw improved sleep habits and less frequent headaches. Seriously - get it. It's free.</p>
				<a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/" title="Little Snapper">Little Snapper</a>
					<p>I feel like my method of saving inspiration before getting LittleSnapper was akin to a cave man. I would have a folder that I would organize by hand every few months and painfully search through before each new project. Now, I use snapper to grab images and full page screenshots, a simple tag &amp; rate system and "smart collections" that grab images with specific tags and organize them. It's amazingly easy to use and has allowed to me find exactly what i need when I need it.</p>
				<a href="https://www.bufferapp.com" title="Buffer">Buffer</a>
					<p>Social Media Management. I have plenty of stuff to share on twitter and facebook but I often find that I share new finds very close to one another. With Buffer, I can space these tweets out so it isn't a barrage of 10 links in an hour. I can set up my tweet, the url I want to share and let it schedule them with ease.</p>
				<a href="http://cordlessdog.com/stay/" title="Stay">Stay</a>
					<p>Gone are the days of arranging windows every time you connect or disocnnect your external monitor. Set up your windows and Stay will store their locations. Once you connect your external monitor, it detects your workspace, and automatically updates your app positions to the way you like them. Piece of cake.</p>
