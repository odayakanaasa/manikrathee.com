<p class="series">This post is a part of the 'How I Use' series.</p>



<p class="intro"><i>"The best camera is the one that's with you."</i></p>


<p><a href="https://carousel.dropbox.com/" title="Carousel" itemprop="url">Carousel</a>, by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTQxOTYwMDg5?src=global9" title="Dropbox" itemprop="url">Dropbox</a><sup>(&percnt;r)</sup>, is a tool that helps you backup, store and view your photos. </p>

<p>I constantly look for ways to improve my photo workflow because it's far from perfect. It's still not very easy to take a handful of photos on two devices and be able to view them in a central location. (I say two devices because a lot of famlies will likely have at least one camera phone and one p&amp;s or SLR camera) Normally, you'd need to either write your own script in concert with an Eye-Fi card, or something similar. This is neither dependable nor very user-friendly.</p>

<p>With Carousel, we're one step closer to a good workflow. First, on your phone (<a href="https://carousel.dropbox.com/photos/app_store_link/ios" title="Carousel for iOS" itemprop="url">iOS</a> or <a href="https://carousel.dropbox.com/photos/app_store_link/android" title="Carousel for Android" itemprop="url">Android</a>), install the app and enable backups. This will take all photos &amp; videos from your camera roll and back them up to your Dropbox account under 'Camera Uploads.' As soon as they're uploaded, you can view them in the Carousel mobile app or <a href="https://carousel.dropbox.com/app/timeline" title="Carousel website" itemprop="url">website</a>.</p>

<p>Once your camera roll is uploaded to Dropbox, we're half-way there. Now, we need to come up with a way to bring our other camera's into Carousel as well. In order to accomplish this, we have to decide on how much work we want to do:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manual &amp; Free:</strong> You can connect your memory card/camera, import the photos directly to your Dropbox dir. <small>Note: any photo within your Dropbox will get indexed by Carousel, so you can keep mobile photos in <em>Camera Uploads</em> and create alternate directories for all of your other cameras.</small></li>

    <li><strong>Hazel:</strong> If you get a copy of <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php" title="Hazel" itemprop="url">Hazel</a> ($29), you can automatically import photos when certain 'external drives' are connected. So, for example, you can watch for drives labeled "CanonMKII," and automatically copy all files into a name-spaced directory within your Dropbox. <small>Personally, I prefer folder names like: "<em>20150405 - Carousel Blog Post</em>." <a href="http://www.manikrathee.com/blog/posts/2015/03/12/how-i-use-textexpander.html#basics" title="Manik Rathee: How I Use TextExpander" itemprop="url">I use TextExpander to easily output Finder&emdash;friendly dates</a>.</small></li>
  </ul>
