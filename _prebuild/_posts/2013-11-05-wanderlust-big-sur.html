<p>This planet is beautiful and life is short. The realization of those two things often leads to a desire to explore, to find new things, and to truly experience life.</p>

<p>Aileen and I have started to do exactly that, and we are documenting all of it. </p>

<h3>Welcome to Wanderlust.</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>These videos &amp; photos are not technical exercises. There will be mistakes. There will be missed timing marks and blurry images. The point isn't to make sure to get the perfect photo but to passively document the moments while living them.</p>
