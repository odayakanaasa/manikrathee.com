<p>Sometimes, when working with git, you end up attempting to undo local changes or reset a git branch to the remote. Here's a mini-guide to accomplish that.</p>

<p>We'll begin with the following assumptions: you have a user branch that is tracking a remote/upstream, you have local edits that you want to <em>discard</em> and you want to reset local to the latest remote/upstream commit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="medium-heading">Confirm local changes</h3>
<p>Make sure you know what changes you're about to lose. If you want to preserve anything for later, you can use <en>stash</en>: <a href="/how-to-stash" title="How to stash and restore an edit with git" itemprop="url">How to stash and restore an edit with git</a></p>
<pre>
  <code class="json">
  git status
  </code>
</pre>

<h3 class="medium-heading">Alternative: Clear files</h3>
<p>Consider whether you can use a simple method to remove untracked files instead of reseting the branch. You can try git clean or checkout:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="json">
  git clean -f
  </code>
</pre>
<p><em>Remove all untracked files.</em></p>
<pre>
  <code class="json">
  git checkout .
  </code>
</pre>
<p><em>Remove all unstaged changes in my working tree.</em></p>

<h3 class="medium-heading">Reset to the latest commit on remote / upstream</h3>
<p>This will remove <strong>all</strong> local changes.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="git">
  git reset --hard HEAD
  </code>
</pre>
<p><em>The result is the same as re-cloning the repository.</em></p>
