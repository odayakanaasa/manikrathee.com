<p><strong>Edit:</strong> More articles &amp; a readlist set has been added at the bottom of this post.</p>


"President Barack Obama's re-election campaign was the most digitally advanced campaign in the history of modern politics. Some of the best developers, engineers and designers in the world came together to build some incredibly intuitive applications and websites that helped manage &amp; monitor GOTV efforts, helped educate voters and spread the word about the President's policies."

<p>Operating within such a groundbreaking team is no easy task. It took dedication and endless amounts of hard work from everyone in every team and department. It really is no suprise that there have been endless articles written about the campaign team thus far. So, I decided to compile a list of all the articles that talk about our various teams: Tech, Frontend Development, Digital Fundraising, Analytics and more.</p>
